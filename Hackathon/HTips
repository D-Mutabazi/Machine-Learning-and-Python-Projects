spike new service spin up?
- how to account for this? (new service , increased price -> accept and disregard as anomaly)

*****s
-- explain service type
-- relationship service and cost
   - threshold
 
   
-- identify anomalies (spike, threshold)and attempt to justify
  - statistical explanation? Visual explanation
  - spikes and values below 0
  - how often they occur
  - flag services not normally used

*Retiefs model? ets model
*anomaly based on specific service type? or general?

- forecast based on window size to train the model, and then predict in the future (generalised)
